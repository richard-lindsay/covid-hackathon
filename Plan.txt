Game starts and users join [G_S_PREGAME] 
When ready, one user presses start and updates game state to be started [G_S_START] 
at this point the roles are given out and users are updated 

Short interlude before first night time (maybe?) for people to see roles

GAME LOOP _______________________________________________________________________________
Night time begins [G_S_NIGHT], short interlude before Mafia wakes up [G_S_N_MAFIA_CHOOSE]

Once they have chosen, and a user has been killed, they get a set amount of time to return 
[G_S_N_MAFIA_RETURN] it is then set back to night time [G_S_NIGHT]

If the doctor is alive game state is set to [G_S_N_DOC_CHOOSE] and the doctor can choose to save a life.
If the doctor is dead, wait a random amount of time before setting back to [G_S_NIGHT]

If the doctor is alive game state is set to [G_S_N_DOC_CHOOSE] and the doctor can choose to save a life.
If the doctor is dead, wait a random amount of time before setting back to [G_S_NIGHT]

Game state is set to daytime [G_S_D_DIS] and the dead player is revealed
Discussion takes place amongst members and a player is chosen to be killed. (Need a voting method)

A player is killed and their role is revealed.
